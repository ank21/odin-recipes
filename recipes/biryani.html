    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically reserved for special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan.
    </p>
    <p>
        It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
        <li>4 small potatoes, peeled and halved</li>
        <li>2 large onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>2 medium tomatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until <br>lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to <br>drain; set aside.</li>
        <li>Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh <br>ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, <br>chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is <br>tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when <br>chicken is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes <br>to reduce the gravy.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden. Add cardamom pods, cloves,<br> cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices.</li>
        <li>Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir well.</li>
        <li>Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 20 minutes without lifting <br> the lid or stirring.</li>
        <li>Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.</li>
    </ol>
